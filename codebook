run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

# define url and choose destination
the url is downloaded and assigned a destination zip file called "data.zip"

# download zip and extract
file is unzipped into a filder called "data"

# read files into tables and bind
all files are read and assigned an object:
- features<- features.txt: 561 rows, 2 cols. features are derived from accelerometer and gyroscope
- activities <- activity_labels.txt: 6 rows, 2 cols. codes for 6 different activities performed (walking, walking upstairs etc.)
- subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 col. subjects id no. for 9 volunteers
- subjects_train <-test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 col. subjects id no. for 21 volunteers 
- x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 cols. all features listed in "features" for all 9 test subjects
- y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 cols. activity codes for the records in x_test
- x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 cols. all features listed in "features" for all 21 train subjects
- y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 cols. activity codes for the records in x_train

# 1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- subjects is creating by row binding subjects_test and subjects_train: 10299 rows, 561 cols
- x is created by row binding x_test and x_train: 10299 rows, 561 cols
- y is created by row binding y-test and y_train: 10299 rows, 1 col
- merged in created by column binding subjects, x, and y: 10299 rows, 563cols

# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
data is created by subsetting "merged" and selecting only the subjects and code columns, and columns containing the words "mean" or "std": 10299 rows, 88 cols

# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
code column in "data" is replaced with corresponding activity name from "activities" 2nd column

# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
features were renamed across the dataset: 
- code converted to acvtivity
- Acc converted to Accelerometer
- Gyro converted to Gyroscope
- BodyBody converted to Body
- Mag converted to Magnitude
- angle converted to Angle
- start with t converted to Time
- strart with f converted to Frequency
- tBody converted to TimeBody
- mean converted to Mean
- std converted to STD
- gravity converted to Gravity

# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
data.final created by summarizing the mean for each variable, grouped by subject and activity: 180 rows, 88 cols   

this file was then exported as data.final.txt
